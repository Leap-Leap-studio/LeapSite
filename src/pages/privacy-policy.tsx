                  <li>Use Study Assistant. Leap is a new solution designed to enhance the learning experience for K-12 students. Many students come home exhausted from a day full of lessons, struggling to organize their homework, manage their time, and develop effective study strategies. This leads to frustration, reduced motivation, and a lack of creativity. Traditional afterschool programs are costly, and online resources can be overwhelming. Leap aims to eliminate these barriers by leveraging AI and an intuitive user interface. With Leap, students access personalized study plans, custom notes, and tailored simulations. Leap also fosters a community where students can connect, collaborate on quizzes, and share insights. The Focus feature minimizes distractions, helping students concentrate on their studies. By integrating neuroscience-based insights about memory processes, Leap helps students learn faster and more effectively. Positioned at the intersection of social and technological innovation, Leap provides a supportive, engaging learning environment. Leap's solution leverages AI to offer personalized study plans, interactive simulations, and social learning opportunities. Unlike traditional afterschool programs, Leap is affordable and accessible, integrating neuroscientific research to optimize study plans for better learning outcomes. The growing EdTech market, focused on personalized learning solutions, presents a significant opportunity for Leap to support K-12 students and their families with structured, affordable afterschool learning.</li>

                <p className="mb-4">
                  Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
